Welcome! My App will allow you to enter your favorite one liners and persist them to a database collecting great one liners!

To get started, the backend must be running. Use the command 'rails s -p 3001' to run the backend on local host 3001.

Then to get the front end running, enter the directory (either in a seperate window or seperate terminal) and use the command 'npm start'
